# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thanks for your interest on contributing to this project 🙌🏻.

Before you start working on your proposal, please browse open issues and PRs to ensure anyone else is working on the same thing. If no one is doing it, then open an issue first requesting for comments and validations from the project maintainers.

If you decide to collaborate and are about to send your changes, please run `yarn validate` in order to ensure everything is running smoothly.

Thanks ❤️
