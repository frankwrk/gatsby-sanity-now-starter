## Requirements

In order to run this starter without running into any issues you need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) [1]
- A [Sanity account](https://sanity.io) [2]
- A [ZEIT account](https://zeit.co) [3]

> [1] Since this is a monorepo, all dependencies should be installed using Yarn.

> [2] The setup script asks to login to Sanity

> [3] The setup script asks to login to ZEIT

## Getting started

### 1. Create a new Gatsby project and use this repo URL as the template

```sh
npx gatsby new my-awesome-blog https://github.com/iamkevinwolf/gatsby-sanity-now-starter
```

### 2. Move into the project directory

```sh
cd my-awesome-blog
```

### 3. Start the web server for both Gatsby site and Sanity Studio

```sh
yarn start
```

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to preview the Gatsby site
- Navigate to http://localhost:3333 to modify your content

### 4. Play around with the Studio

Try changing the site settings or adding new posts, click `Publish` and view your changes in real-time.

> If you want a more detailed guide on how to create new schemas, check at your local readme file, this had been replaced in order to show information relevant to your project.

### 5. Deploy your site

```sh
yarn deploy
```

- Navigate to https://your-site-url.now.sh to see the production website
- Navigate to https://your-site-url.now.sh/studio to edit your site content through a self-hosted Sanity Studio [1]

> [1] If you go to this URL just after finish the deploy, you will receive an origin error. This is because you still need to add your production site as a trusted origin to Sanity.

### 6. Add your production site as a trusted origin to Sanity

1. Go to [Sanity Manage](https://manage.sanity.io) and select your newly created project
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Click on `ADD NEW ORIGIN`
4. Enter your now.sh project url and toggle on the `Allow credentials` switch
5. Click on `ADD NEW ORIGIN`

### 7. Create a deployment hook to re-deploy the site when content changes

Since static sites don't tend to be fetching any server to get the content, you need to re-build it everytime you change your data in Sanity. This process can be tedious, so you can enable a Deploy Hook on ZEIT that can be called from anywhere to trigger a deploy of your site.

1. If you haven't already, push your site to GitHub
2. Go to your [ZEIT dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard) and select your project
3. If you haven't already, link your project with the GitHub repo by clicking the `Edit` link under the project name
4. Navigate to the `Settings` tab on the navigation bar above your project title
5. Enter the hook name (i.e. `Sanity Trigger`), select the branch you want to get built when Sanity content changes and click `Create Hook`
6. Copy the Deploy Hook url
7. Go to [Sanity Manage](https://manage.sanity.io) and select your project
8. Navigate to Settings > API
9. Click on `ADD NEW WEBHOOK`
10. Add a name to the webhook (i.e. `ZEIT Deployment`), paste the ZEIT Deploy Hook url and select the dataset you want to trigger that change
11. Click `ADD NEW WEBHOOK`
